# GSIV Blue-Tracker Setup Guide

A Discord application that tracks and mirrors GemStone IV staff messages from the official server to a dedicated tracking server. This application crawls historical messages and relays new ones in real-time.

## üéØ What This Application Does

- **Live Relay**: Instantly reposts GM/CM messages to a central tracking channel
- **Mirror Hierarchy**: Recreates the source server's channel structure for organized browsing
- **Historical Crawling**: Slowly crawls years of message history without hitting rate limits
- **GitHub Backups**: Automatically backs up the database for safekeeping
- **Replay Mode**: Can replay all stored messages to rebuild mirror channels

## üèóÔ∏è Hosting Platform

This guide uses **Fly.io** for hosting, but the application can run on any platform that supports Python and persistent storage. We chose Fly.io because:

- Simple deployment with Docker
- Reliable persistent volumes
- Good free tier (3 shared VMs included)
- Easy secret management

**Alternative hosting options** (not covered in this guide):
- Railway, Render, DigitalOcean App Platform
- Self-hosted VPS (Linux server)
- Local machine (less reliable)

**Note**: We couldn't find a completely free hosting solution that met our needs (persistent storage + 24/7 uptime), but Fly.io costs only ~$5-10/month.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting, you'll need:

1. **Discord Account**: Your personal Discord account that can see the GemStone IV server
2. **GitHub Account**: For database backups (optional but recommended)
3. **Fly.io Account**: For hosting the application (or alternative hosting platform)
4. **Credit Card**: Fly.io requires payment info (free tier available)

## üöÄ Step 1: Create Fly.io Account

1. Go to [fly.io](https://fly.io)
2. Click **"Sign Up"** 
3. Create account with GitHub or email
4. **Add payment method** (required even for free tier)
5. Install the Fly CLI:
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install flyctl
   
   # Windows (PowerShell)
   iwr https://fly.io/install.ps1 -useb | iex
   
   # Linux
   curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
   ```
6. Login to Fly CLI:
   ```bash
   flyctl auth login
   ```

## üîß Step 2: Clone and Setup Repository

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nisugi/GSIV-BlueTracker.git
   cd GSIV-BlueTracker
   ```

2. **Review the configuration:**
   Open `bot/config.py` and verify:
   - `SOURCE_GUILD_ID`: Should be `226045346399256576` (GemStone IV server)
   - `AGGREGATOR_GUILD_ID`: Your tracking server ID
   - `CENTRAL_CHAN_ID`: Your central tracking channel ID
   - `REPLAY_MODE`: Set to `False` for normal operation

## üîë Step 3: Get Your Discord Token

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: User applications violate Discord's Terms of Service. Use at your own risk.**

1. Open Discord in your web browser (not the app)
2. Login to your account
3. Open Developer Tools (F12)
4. Go to **Network** tab
5. Type something in any channel
6. Look for a request called **"typing"**
7. In the request headers, find **"Authorization"**
8. Copy the value after "Authorization: " (this is your token)

**Keep this token secret! Don't share it with anyone.**

## üèóÔ∏è Step 4: Create Your Tracking Server

If you don't already have a Discord server for tracking:

1. Create a new Discord server
2. Create a channel called `#gm-tracker`
3. Note the server ID and channel ID:
   - Enable Developer Mode in Discord settings
   - Right-click server name ‚Üí Copy Server ID
   - Right-click channel ‚Üí Copy Channel ID
4. Update `bot/config.py` with these IDs

## üåê Step 5: Deploy to Fly.io

1. **Create the Fly app:**
   ```bash
   flyctl apps create blue-tracker
   ```

2. **Create a volume for database storage:**
   ```bash
   flyctl volumes create db_volume --region dfw --size 1
   ```

3. **Set your Discord token as a secret:**
   ```bash
   flyctl secrets set DISCORD_TOKEN="your_discord_token_here"
   ```

4. **Set GitHub token for backups (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   flyctl secrets set GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token_here"
   ```

5. **Deploy the bot:**
   ```bash
   flyctl deploy
   ```

## üîÑ Step 6: GitHub Backup Setup (Optional)

To enable automatic database backups:

1. **Create a GitHub repository** for storing backups
2. **Create a fine-grained personal access token:**
   - Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens ‚Üí Fine-grained tokens
   - Click "Generate new token"
   - Select your backup repository
   - Grant **Contents: Read and write** permissions
   - Copy the token

3. **Update the repository name in code:**
   Edit `bot/github_backup.py`:
   ```python
   REPO = "YourUsername/YourBackupRepo"  # Change this line
   ```

4. **Set the token:**
   ```bash
   flyctl secrets set GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token_here"
   ```

## üîç Step 7: Monitor and Verify

1. **Check logs to see if it's working:**
   ```bash
   flyctl logs
   ```

2. **Look for these startup messages:**
   ```
   [Application] Logged in as YourUsername#1234 (123456789)
   [DB] posts table currently holds 0 rows.
   [crawler] Starting slow crawl with 3650 day cutoff
   ```

3. **Send a test message** in the GemStone IV server if you have GM/CM role, or wait for a real GM message

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 8: Configuration Options

### Normal Operation Mode
- Set `REPLAY_MODE = False` in `bot/config.py`
- Application will crawl historical messages slowly and relay new ones live

### Replay Mode (for rebuilding channels)
- Set `REPLAY_MODE = True` in `bot/config.py`
- Deploy the update: `flyctl deploy`
- Application will replay all stored messages, then switch to normal crawling
- **Set back to `False`** after replay completes

### Adding New Staff Members
Edit `SEED_BLUE_IDS` in `bot/config.py` to add new GM/CM user IDs:
```python
SEED_BLUE_IDS = {
    308821099863605249,  # Wyrom
    # Add new IDs here
    123456789012345678,  # New GM Name
}
```

## üìä Management Commands

### View logs:
```bash
flyctl logs
```

### View app status:
```bash
flyctl status
```

### Restart the application:
```bash
flyctl apps restart blue-tracker
```

### Scale resources (if needed):
```bash
flyctl scale memory 512  # Reduce to 512MB
flyctl scale memory 1024 # Increase to 1GB
```

### Access database (advanced):
```bash
flyctl ssh console
# Inside the container:
sqlite3 /data/bluetracker.db
.tables
.quit
exit
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Application won't start:
- Check logs: `flyctl logs`
- Verify Discord token is correct
- Ensure account can see the source server

### No messages being tracked:
- Verify `SOURCE_GUILD_ID` matches GemStone IV server
- Check that tracked users have the right roles
- Look for permission errors in logs

### Mirror channels not created:
- Verify `AGGREGATOR_GUILD_ID` is correct
- Ensure account is in the tracking server
- Check for webhook creation errors in logs

### Database issues:
- Volume might be full: `flyctl volumes list`
- Check volume mount in `fly.toml`

### Rate limiting:
- Application automatically handles Discord rate limits
- GitHub backup failures are logged but won't stop the application

## üí∞ Cost Estimates

**Fly.io costs (as of 2024):**
- **Shared CPU, 1GB RAM**: ~$5-10/month
- **1GB Volume**: ~$0.15/month
- **Total**: ~$5-11/month

**Free tier includes:**
- 3 shared-cpu-1x VMs
- 160GB outbound data transfer

## üîí Security Notes

- **Never share your Discord token**
- **User applications violate Discord TOS** - use at your own risk
- **GitHub tokens** should have minimal permissions (Contents: read/write only)
- **Fly secrets** are encrypted and not visible in logs

## üìù Maintenance

### Regular tasks:
- **Monitor logs** for errors: `flyctl logs`
- **Check database size**: Growth rate depends on message volume
- **Update staff IDs** when GMs join/leave

### Updates:
1. Pull latest code: `git pull`
2. Deploy: `flyctl deploy`
3. Monitor logs for issues

## üÜò Support

If you run into issues:

1. **Check the logs first**: `flyctl logs`
2. **Review configuration**: Verify all IDs and tokens
3. **Test Discord access**: Ensure your account can see both servers
4. **GitHub Issues**: Report bugs with relevant log snippets
